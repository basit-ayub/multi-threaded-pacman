# Multithreaded Pac-Man Game (C + SFML)

This project is a multithreaded recreation of the classic Pac-Man game, developed in **C** using the **SFML** graphics library. It was built as a semester project for the **Operating Systems** course at **FAST NUCES Islamabad, Spring 2025**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The game simulates real-time interaction between Pac-Man and multiple ghosts using POSIX threads (`pthreads`). Each major game component runs on its own thread with proper synchronization using **mutexes** and **semaphores**, following classic concurrency patterns.
